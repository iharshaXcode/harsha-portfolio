            <h1 class="profile_title">About me</h1><br>
            <p>I am an enthusiastic software developer with a strong foundation in Information Science and Engineering, having graduated Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) from Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU)   (2024). My journey into technology began with a curiosity about how things work, and over the years, this curiosity has evolved into a passion for problem-solving through software development.</p><br>

            <p>I have a strong interest in creating solutions that not only solve problems but also improve user experiences. My technical expertise lies in full-stack web development, database management, and building secure systems. My work is driven by a desire to innovate and continuously improve. One of my key achievements is the development of a secure online voting system that integrated biometric technologies for enhanced security and was recognized at a state-level exhibition.</p><br>

            <p>Outside of coding, I have a passion for teaching and community service. I enjoy giving back by tutoring students in computer science and participating in technology education initiatives for underprivileged children. I believe that technology has the power to transform lives, and I am committed to sharing that knowledge with others.</p><br>

            <p>In my free time, you can find me honing my strategic thinking through chess or capturing moments through my love for photography. I enjoy working on personal coding projects and continuously expanding my knowledge through learning new technologies and concepts.</p><br>

            <p>As I continue to grow in my career, my goal is to remain curious, adaptable, and innovative, driving value to every organization I work with.</p><br><br><br><br>

                    <b>Description: </b>Developed a secure, biometric-enhanced voting platform that integrates the Haar-cascade algorithm for precise facial recognition, achieving a 25% improvement in voter identification accuracy. The system leverages two-factor authentication with facial detection and OTP verification, significantly reducing unauthorized access attempts and providing a secure, user-friendly alternative to traditional voting methods. Published findings on this innovative platform at the IEEE International Conference on Advances in Information Technology (ICAIT-24), underscoring its impact on improving both security and accessibility in electronic voting systems.
                    
                    <p><b>Impact :</b>Provided a secure, efficient, and accessible alternative to traditional voting methods, ensuring robust security against unauthorized access during elections.
